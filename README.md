# kaustubhhiware.github.io

Hello !

This is my [website](kaustubhhiware.github.io).

The current version is hand-built from scratch. Snippets of perfect code found from places you'd least expect it.

So, in case you decide to use it, it won't hurt to mention it on your website. Allonsy!


## Blog

The current blog is served on jekyll. Learn how to set your own blog [here](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/).
I am using [Jekyll now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) theme for my blog.


The following commands are going to be used again and again during development.

    bundler update

and

    bundler exec jekyll serve
