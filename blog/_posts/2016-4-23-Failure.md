title: Failure

My previous article was a poem I wrote , for a friend who had to face rejection even on trying his best.

While writing it , and adding tags on my Medium blog, I thought it won’t be such bad idea to add the Failure tag.
Life tag has 49K followers , Success has 5.5K , and Failure has just 1.5K.

I think we should appreciate failure more . As the above image depicts , failure and success are the two parts of life .

How can any discussion , or medium here , be complete if only half of Life’s essence is appreciated ?
