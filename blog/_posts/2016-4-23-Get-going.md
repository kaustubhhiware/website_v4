We have all faced tough times ,  

when nothing rhymes .

when someone shines,

it feels a crime.

You feel like crying,

from inside , you’re dying.

This is all wrong.

I can’t take it anymore.

You’re trapped on an island , 

on its shore.

That island is despair , 

pretend you don’t care .

Stop .Listen up.

Gather you energy and push the level up.

Break the barriers , 

reach for the stars,

Heck, look behind the bars,

of loneliness , and failure.

That’s not me , you feel insecure.

Quit pitying you , you are your own savior .

You wish , you will , you work , 

everyone thinks you’re going berserk.

But that doesn’t matter now , 

what matters is you .

This is the only time you know what is true ,

so get up and work for that dream.

you efforts fill up to the brim.

When glory is yours , you know this is it.


Everyone praises for you’ve done it.

Only you know the struggle you’ve faced , 

that should really be for the praise , 

You get this all , just by knowing.

you know this was rough ,

but you hadn’t been showing.

because when the going goes tough ,

the tough goes going.
