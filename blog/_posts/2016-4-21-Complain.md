title: Why complaining helps
---
Summer is here ! And so is the seasons of coolers and AC’s , and not to forget the pointless conversations people have how hot it is .Often , you’ll find people arguing that clearly their situation is worse , and why they’re suffering more . We’ll keep that topic for another time.

The main point of their conversations is how unbearably hot it is ,and often I overhear them and wonder , what exactly is the point of complaining ?

There is absolutely nothing you could do to improve your situations of distress like these , similar to I will have to put in a lot of effort to complete this project/assignment in time .

>People have an extraordinary power of stating the obvious.

I mean , seriously ?What is the point of having a conversation if you do not seek a solution , and are already aware of the solution?Except if someone who reads this actually comes up with a solution with the weather crisis, and proves this story wrong , kudos .
A closer look explains it is not the remedy they seek for , it is sympathy .The way I think of it , human beings are really lonely creatures , floating into blank space , with no where to hold on .Many “ Life Coaches ” , including some of your and my teachers ,must have pointed out you must have a good friend circle in order to go ahead in life .

>A man is known by the company he keeps.

At that point , I felt this was pretentious , and ended up having no ‘close’ friends , but now I’ve realized it -a friend circle / group is required to sympathize with you .To cry when you cry , and enjoy with when you’re happy .In a group , the worst caliber you could have is the lowest , which improves with how good friends you have . As a result , when you share your grievances with your group , they could help in resolving those conflicts .So , complaining does help in your own development .

Even though complaining about weather has no output on weather conditions , the people with whom you share your problems become closer to you , you gain a level of trust and confidence in them , that is , they find you more approachable and it becomes easier for them to confide in you .

They communicate with you .They complain with you . They share ideas with you .And ultimately , they develop you .
So , keep complaining , keep communicating ,keep sharing ;otherwise what difference between us and mute animals ?
