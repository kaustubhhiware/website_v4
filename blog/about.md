I am a 3rd year undergraduate pursuing a major in Computer Science and Engineering at [Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur](http://www1.iitkgp.ac.in/). I am accustomed to working on Linux operating systems. My interests include Competitive Programming, Open Source, NLP,  Reading, whenever I am not "learning" from others.

I take interest in learning about life through movies and TV series. I'm open to recommendations.

I like to invest myself in long, informed, and elaborate discussions about technology, religion, movies, humans, politics; not necesarily in that order. Basically, all topics under the sun.

I like to write blogs on [Medium](https://medium.com/@hikaus), you can check that as well.
