&lt;p&gt;when nothing rhymes .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;when someone shines,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it feels a crime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You feel like crying,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;from inside , you’re dying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is all wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t take it anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re trapped on an island ,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;on its shore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That island is despair ,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;pretend you don’t care .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stop .Listen up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gather you energy and push the level up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Break the barriers ,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;reach for the stars,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heck, look behind the bars,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;of loneliness , and failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s not me , you feel insecure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quit pitying you , you are your own savior .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You wish , you will , you work ,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;everyone thinks you’re going berserk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that doesn’t matter now ,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;what matters is you .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the only time you know what is true ,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so get up and work for that dream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you efforts fill up to the brim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When glory is yours , you know this is it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone praises for you’ve done it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only you know the struggle you’ve faced ,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;that should really be for the praise ,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You get this all , just by knowing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you know this was rough ,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but you hadn’t been showing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;because when the going goes tough ,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the tough goes going.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">We have all faced tough times ,</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Failure</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/Failure/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Failure" /><published>2016-04-23T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2016-04-23T00:00:00+05:30</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/Failure</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/Failure/">&lt;p&gt;My previous article was a poem I wrote , for a friend who had to face rejection even on trying his best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While writing it , and adding tags on my Medium blog, I thought it won’t be such bad idea to add the Failure tag.
Life tag has 49K followers , Success has 5.5K , and Failure has just 1.5K.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/yin-yan.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Yin and Yan of life&quot; title=&quot;Source : 9GAG (Facebook)&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think we should appreciate failure more . As the above image depicts , failure and success are the two parts of life .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can any discussion , or medium here , be complete if only half of Life’s essence is appreciated ?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">My previous article was a poem I wrote , for a friend who had to face rejection even on trying his best.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Destination</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/Destiny/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Destination" /><published>2016-04-22T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2016-04-22T00:00:00+05:30</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/Destiny</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/Destiny/">&lt;p&gt;Rather than finding a map, find a Destination.

And so is the seasons of coolers and AC’s , and not to forget the pointless conversations people have how hot it is .Often , you’ll find people arguing that clearly their situation is worse , and why they’re suffering more . We’ll keep that topic for another time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main point of their conversations is how unbearably hot it is ,and often I overhear them and wonder , what exactly is the point of complaining ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is absolutely nothing you could do to improve your situations of distress like these , similar to I will have to put in a lot of effort to complete this project/assignment in time .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;People have an extraordinary power of stating the obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean , seriously ?What is the point of having a conversation if you do not seek a solution , and are already aware of the solution?Except if someone who reads this actually comes up with a solution with the weather crisis, and proves this story wrong , kudos .
A closer look explains it is not the remedy they seek for , it is sympathy .The way I think of it , human beings are really lonely creatures , floating into blank space , with no where to hold on .Many “ Life Coaches ” , including some of your and my teachers ,must have pointed out you must have a good friend circle in order to go ahead in life .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A man is known by the company he keeps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At that point , I felt this was pretentious , and ended up having no ‘close’ friends , but now I’ve realized it -a friend circle / group is required to sympathize with you .To cry when you cry , and enjoy with when you’re happy .In a group , the worst caliber you could have is the lowest , which improves with how good friends you have . As a result , when you share your grievances with your group , they could help in resolving those conflicts .So , complaining does help in your own development .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though complaining about weather has no output on weather conditions , the people with whom you share your problems become closer to you , you gain a level of trust and confidence in them , that is , they find you more approachable and it becomes easier for them to confide in you .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They communicate with you .They complain with you . They share ideas with you .And ultimately , they develop you .
So , keep complaining , keep communicating ,keep sharing ;otherwise what difference between us and mute animals ?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Summer is here !
